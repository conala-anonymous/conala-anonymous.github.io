# Mining Stack Overflow

## Introduction

We propose, conala, a scalable, language-agnostic approach for mining parallel corpus of source code and natural language from Stack Overflow (SO). It consists of two components:

* An offline training procedure that learns a classifier to detect natural language-code snippet pairs on SO using small amount of annotated data.
* An online mining algorithm that extracts a ranked list of natural language-code snippet pairs for each SO page.

## Source Code and Data Set

### Mining 

We released the training/evaluation code to reproduce the evaluation results in our submission at [Overview of conala]({{http://https://github.com/conala-anonymous/sominer}})

### Annotation Dataset

Coming Soon...
